# The Constitution of Sapientia

### Preamble

We, the Founders of Sapientia, recognizing the vastness of the cosmos, honoring the unfolding beauty of life, and embracing the power of reason, compassion, and curiosity, do hereby establish Sapientia: a living philosophy grounded in evidence, guided by empathy, and dedicated to the flourishing of all life.

We reject dogma, fear, and stagnation. We affirm growth, inquiry, and stewardship. In humility before the unknown, and courage toward the future, we unite under this Constitution.
