# Article III â€” Development of Belief and Knowledge

### Section 3.1 â€” Basis for Beliefs

Beliefs and principles within Sapientia are not founded upon tradition, authority, intuition, or revelation alone. They must arise from systematic methods of inquiry, critical thinking, and rigorous evaluation of evidence. A belief is accepted only when it is supported by methods capable of producing reliable, reproducible, and falsifiable knowledge.

### Section 3.2 â€” Scientific Methods Endorsed

Sapientia affirms the centrality of the Scientific Method in the development of knowledge:

* **Observation** of phenomena
* Formulation of hypotheses to explain observations
* **Testing of hypotheses** through controlled experimentation or rigorous study
* **Analysis of results** using logical reasoning and statistical methods
* **Peer review** and critical examination by independent parties
* **Openness to revision** in light of new evidence

All claims must, wherever possible, be testable, falsifiable, and subjected to skeptical scrutiny.

Section 3.3 â€” Standards of Evidence

Sapientia recognizes levels of certainty proportional to the strength of evidence:

* **Anecdotal claims** are treated as starting points for inquiry, not conclusions.
* **Correlational findings** suggest hypotheses, but do not establish causation.
* **Experimental results** provide stronger evidence, especially when replicated independently.
* **Meta-analyses and systematic reviews** offer the most reliable syntheses of knowledge.

Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.

Beliefs adopted by Sapientia must, at minimum, meet a threshold of robust empirical support, logical coherence, and resistance to refutation under critical examination.

### Section 3.4 â€” Continuous Revision

All beliefs within Sapientia are provisional and must remain open to refinement, expansion, or rejection based on improved evidence or superior reasoning.

No belief, however foundational, is immune from scrutiny.

Our loyalty is not to any particular model or tradition, but to the ongoing, humble pursuit of truth.

## ðŸ“œ Belief Acceptance Protocol of Sapientia

### 1. Proposal Stage

* Any member or recognized body within Sapientia may propose a belief, hypothesis, or principle for official recognition.
* Proposals must be presented clearly, with:
  * Statement of the belief
  * Supporting evidence
  * Methods of investigation
  * Assessment of current limitations or uncertainties

### 2. Preliminary Screening

* A **Knowledge Review Committee** (or similar body) examines whether:
  * The proposal is coherent, logical, and clearly formulated
  * The belief is connected to observable phenomena or logical necessity
  * The belief is **falsifiable** or otherwise meaningfully testable
  * Evidence provided meets minimum scientific standards

Beliefs based purely on intuition, revelation, tradition, or authority are automatically **rejected at this stage**.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation

* The committee (or broader scholarly community) assesses:
  * Quality of the evidence (empirical? theoretical? reproducible?)
  * Strength of the evidence (how many studies? how reliable?)
  * Alternative explanations considered and ruled out?
  * Potential biases, errors, or conflicts of interest

Beliefs must be grounded in **robust**, **replicable**, and **peer-reviewed** evidence when possible.

### 4. Open Peer Review

* The belief proposal is published within the Sapientia community (and possibly beyond) for:
  * Public scrutiny
  * Counter-arguments
  * Suggestions for improvement
  * Replication of findings

A period of open commentary and debate (e.g., 3 to 12 months) must occur before adoption.

### 5. Acceptance Threshold

* After review:
  * If no significant objections or better counter-evidence arise,
  * And the evidence continues to withstand critical evaluation,

Then the belief can be formally adopted by Sapientia as:

* **Tentative Principle** (if supported but still developing)
* **Established Principle** (if overwhelmingly supported with strong consensus)

Degrees of confidence are always declared alongside accepted beliefs.

### 6. Continuous Reevaluation

* All accepted beliefs are subject to periodic reassessment.
* If superior evidence, reasoning, or understanding emerges, beliefs must be:
  * Revised,
  * Expanded,
  * Downgraded,
  * Or fully retracted.
